### Hi there 👋

**Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile, it's great to meet you here!** 😊

Here are some quick things about me:

- 🔭 I'm a pragmatic software engineer who is paranoid about convention, consistency, and constraints.
- 🕵️‍♀️ I like doing quality work, and a real asshole on pull request reviews.
- 🧸 I'm proud of who I am, what I have built, and what I am building.
- 🧑‍💻 Coding is my passion.
- 📫 The best way to reach me is to send me an email.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once drove to the [Half Moon Bay](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Half+Moon+Bay,+CA,+USA) for sun rise (hint: it's on the west coast).
- 📰 If you like my work, please consider give my newsletter [Identity, Authenticity, and Security](https://unknwon.substack.com/) a look!
